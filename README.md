# Property Market Analysis
This is a tool is designed to evaluate the potential for investments in the housing rental market in the city of San Francisco, California.  The analysis leverages the power of data analysis visualization using python's PyViz packages. Several key variables were analyzed over a period of six years (2010-2016), including the prices per square foot by year and gross rent for each neighborhood in the city. The results are presented in several visualally appealing, interactive charts that can be manipulated by the user. The outcome of the analysis is a recommendation regarding the potential for a 'one-click' service for investors to purchase a property and rent it for a steady income stream.
